# Kickstarter Data Analysis

This report analyzes 4114 Kickstarter projects between the years 2009 and 2017. 

## Hope You're Making Games or Music
Both the games and music stood out from other categories with 77% percent of those projects being funded. The next closest category was 17% less likely to be funded. The data doesn't explain why these projects tended to be more successful. In contrast, all journalism projects failed so consider other platforms or method for funding similar projects.

## Avoid December Project Launches
Over 9 years, December showed the lowest counts of project success. In the same months, the numbers of failed and canceled projects also increased. This remained true across categories with the publishing category being the only major exception. One might speculate that holiday spending and/or giving means that households have less cash to spare on Kickstarter projects. Alternately, it may be tempting to look at the data and assume May is the best month to launch a project. However, the number of failed projects increase in May while canceled projects hold a steady rate. It would be more accurate to say more projects have launched historically in that month overall. 

## The Bigger the Goal, the Riskier the Project
Overall, project success trended downward as the dollar amount of the goal increased. Projects with a goal under $1000 were 70% successful while projects with a goal above $50,000 were only 19% successful. 

## What about the backers?
This data does not analyze one of Kickstarter's defining features, which is the levels of rewards for project backers. Backers contribute to projects at increasing levels of funding which unlock increasing reward values. As a former fundraiser, I want to know the number of reward levels and the distribution of backers among those levels. This might tease up best practices for choosing the number and scale of reward levels. 

For example, 100% of tabletop games were funded in this dataset. Based on my own experience as a backer and without seeing any data, I'd hypothesize that most backers chose a reward level that included a copy of the game. I'd expect the distribution of backers to be clustered around that reward level. Based on my knowledge of fundraising for the arts, I imagine that plays would have a handful of high level backers with more backers clustered around lower reward levels regardless of the actual reward.

Per category, it would also be useful to see demographic data particularly location and income for the backers of these projects to get a sense of where to promote them in online spaces. 

## Statistical Analysis
The high level of variance demonstrates the values in this dataset are spread out, thus indicating that the median is a more useful summary of this dataset. Successful campaigns have a higher level of variance than unsuccessful campaigns. This makes sense â€“ failed campaigns had fewer backers on average while successful campaigns were able to meet the goal with a wide range of backers. Some projects were able to meet their goal with a small number of backers while others were successful by attracting large numbers of backers.
